I am a Ph.D. student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, in School of Computing, advised by [Alice Oh](https://aliceoh9.github.io/).

My research interests are in discovering latent patterns from unstructured data collected from Internet and developing technology that helps people to socialize and collaborate better in online.
I study machine learning algorithms and models to analyze the big data collected from social media posts, collaborative writing platforms, or online courses.

My previous research includes predicting demographic information and political stance of Twitter users in Korea, analyzing connections between users in different demographic groups,  
measuring conflicts between users from different cultures in edit history of Wikipedia articles, and measuring language complexity of bilinguals in edit history of Wikipedia articles.

Recently, I am working on predicting video rewatching behaviors in web-based CS education platform and developing customized video summarization algorithm for lecture videos.
